Local Store is a simple and user-friendly e-commerce platform built for small businesses in your area. Customers can browse a variety of handmade and organic products, view product details, and make informed purchasing decisions. Each product listing includes an image, description, and price. The platform is built using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. All product data is stored locally, making it ideal for small-scale or educational use. Itâ€™s a great starting point for learning how e-commerce sites work without using databases like MongoDB.
